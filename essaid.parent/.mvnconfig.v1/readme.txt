Directories in this directory are used to control profiles inherited
from the  essaid.top.pom artifact. Moving a directory to the "off" sub
folder disables  its effect.

The .mvnconfig.v* directory (like .mvnconfig.v1) is a template
with a version qualifier. Each child project will start by copying the
versioned directory and use in the .mvnconfig  directory as needed.
